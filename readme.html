<p><b>Error - Could not generate an access token</b>
<p>If you see this error be sure to synchronize the time on your Phantom host machine. Cylance uses a time-based authorization and will deny API requests if the clock on your Splunk Phantom server has drifted. For example, the following command can be used to update your system time:
<p>sudo ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com
