### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

**Error - Could not generate an access token**

If you see this error be sure to synchronize the time on your Phantom host machine. Cylance uses a
time-based authorization and will deny API requests if the clock on your Splunk Phantom server has
drifted. For example, the following command can be used to update your system time:

sudo ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com
